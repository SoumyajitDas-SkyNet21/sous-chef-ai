# üî™ Sous Chef AI: Structured Recipe Curator

**Sous Chef AI** is an intelligent, interactive web application built with **Streamlit** and **LangChain**. It leverages the power of OpenAI's LLMs to generate high-quality, perfectly structured cooking recipes based on user-defined ingredients, cuisine, and dietary preferences.

The core innovation is using **LangChain's structured output capabilities** combined with **Pydantic schemas** to guarantee the LLM's response is a valid, usable JSON object, making the application robust and reliable.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Structured Recipe Output**  
  Uses Pydantic to enforce a strict Recipe data structure, including fields for instructions, ingredients, metadata, and nutritional facts. This eliminates typical LLM output inconsistencies.

- **Dynamic Quantity Scaling**  
  Adjust a slider to change the number of servings. Ingredients are automatically recalculated, intelligently handling fractions and units.

- **Contextual Recipe Suggestions**  
  Generates three similar recipe ideas from the same cuisine, including their local (native) names. Click to generate a new recipe immediately.

- **Enriched Metadata**  
  Each recipe includes a calculated caloric estimate per serving, a historical fact about the dish, and a nutritional tip.

- **User-Friendly UI**  
  Built with Streamlit for a clean, responsive, and intuitive interface.

### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

![Sous Chef AI Workflow](https://your-image-link-here.com/workflow.png)


1. **User Input:**  
   - Users enter a list of available ingredients in the sidebar.  
   - Optionally, users select cuisine, dietary restrictions, and skill level.

2. **Prompt Processing:**  
   - The input is sent to the **LangChain pipeline**, which structures a prompt for the LLM.  
   - **Pydantic schemas** validate that the output will be in a consistent JSON format.

3. **Recipe Generation:**  
   - OpenAI's **gpt-4o-mini** model generates the recipe based on the structured prompt.  
   - The recipe includes:  
     - Step-by-step cooking instructions  
     - Ingredient list with quantities  
     - Metadata such as estimated calories, historical facts, and nutritional tips  

4. **Dynamic Scaling:**  
   - Users can adjust the **servings slider**, and ingredient quantities are automatically recalculated, intelligently handling fractions and units.

5. **Contextual Suggestions:**  
   - Three similar recipes from the same cuisine are generated for inspiration.  
   - Users can click any suggestion to instantly generate a new recipe.

6. **Interactive UI:**  
   - The recipe, scaling, and suggestions are displayed in a clean, responsive **Streamlit interface**.  
   - Users can interact seamlessly, generating multiple recipes without reloading the app.
