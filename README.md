# üî™ Sous Chef AI: Structured Recipe Curator

**Sous Chef AI** is an intelligent, interactive web application built with **Streamlit** and **LangChain**. It leverages the power of OpenAI's LLMs to generate high-quality, perfectly structured cooking recipes based on user-defined ingredients, cuisine, and dietary preferences.

The core innovation is using **LangChain's structured output capabilities** combined with **Pydantic schemas** to guarantee the LLM's response is a valid, usable JSON object, making the application robust and reliable.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Structured Recipe Output**  
  Uses Pydantic to enforce a strict Recipe data structure, including fields for instructions, ingredients, metadata, and nutritional facts. This eliminates typical LLM output inconsistencies.

- **Dynamic Quantity Scaling**  
  Adjust a slider to change the number of servings. Ingredients are automatically recalculated, intelligently handling fractions and units.

- **Contextual Recipe Suggestions**  
  Generates three similar recipe ideas from the same cuisine, including their local (native) names. Click to generate a new recipe immediately.

- **Enriched Metadata**  
  Each recipe includes a calculated caloric estimate per serving, a historical fact about the dish, and a nutritional tip.

- **User-Friendly UI**  
  Built with Streamlit for a clean, responsive, and intuitive interface.
